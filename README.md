# 🛒 AI‑Powered Price Comparison & Prediction Platform
📌 Problem Statement :
Online shoppers must manually compare product prices across platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, which is time-consuming and inefficient. There is no single intelligent system that provides real-time price comparison, review analysis, and smart purchase recommendations. This project aims to build an AI-powered MERN stack application that aggregates product data from multiple platforms and recommends the best buying option to help users save time and money.

A full‑stack, AI‑powered web application that allows users to **compare product prices across platforms** and **predict future price movements** (high/low trends) using intelligent analysis.

This project goes beyond basic price comparison by integrating:
- 🤖 An **AI Agent** for smart analysis
- 📈 **Price Prediction** to help users decide the *best time to buy*

Built with modern web technologies and real‑time APIs.
